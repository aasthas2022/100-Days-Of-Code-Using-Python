## Day 13 - Section 13: Beginner - Debugging: How to Find and Fix Errors in your Code

''' Suggested steps:
- Describe the problem in your head - Untangle the problem
- Reproduce the bug
- Fix errors in IDE befre you continue
- Squash bugs with a print() statement
- Use a debugger
- Take a break and come back
- Ask for an external perspective
- Run your code often - after every little code execution
- Ask stackoverflow

Fix the code so that it works and passes the tests when you submit.

The code needs to print the solution to the FizzBuzz game.

Your program should print each number from 1 to x where x is the input number.

However when the number is divisible by 3 then instead of printing the number it should print "Fizz".

When the number is divisible by 5, then instead of printing the number it should print "Buzz".

And if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 e.g. 15 then instead of the number it should print "FizzBuzz".

target = int(input())
for number in range(1, target + 1):
  if number % 3 == 0 or number % 5 == 0:
    print("FizzBuzz")
  if number % 3 == 0:
    print("Fizz")
  if number % 5 == 0:
    print("Buzz")
  else:
    print([number])

target = int(input())

  elif number % 3 == 0:
    print("Fizz")
  elif number % 5 == 0:
    print("Buzz")
  else:
    print(number)
