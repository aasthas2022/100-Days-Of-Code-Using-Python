##Day 7 - Section 7: Beginner - Hangman

## Hangman 1 - Write a program that selects a word from a list, prompts the user to guess a letter, and checks if the guessed letter is in the chosen word. Make sure to account for letter case.
#Step 1 

word_list = ["aardvark", "baboon", "camel"]

#TODO-1 - Randomly choose a word from the word_list and assign it to a variable called chosen_word.
import random
chosen_word = word_list[random.randint(0, len(word_list) - 1)] # chosen_word = random.choice(word_list)
print(chosen_word)

#TODO-2 - Ask the user to guess a letter and assign their answer to a variable called guess. Make guess lowercase.
guess = str(input("Guess the letter: ")).lower()
print(guess)

#TODO-3 - Check if the letter the user guessed (guess) is one of the letters in the chosen_word.
for each_letter in chosen_word:
    if each_letter == guess:
        print("right")
    print("wrong")


## Hangman 2: Given a randomly chosen word from a list, prompt the user to guess a letter. Then, reveal if the guessed letter is correct and update the display to show the guessed letter in its correct position within the word.

#Step 2

import random
word_list = ["aardvark", "baboon", "camel"]
chosen_word = random.choice(word_list)

#Testing code
print(f'Pssst, the solution is {chosen_word}.')

#TODO-1: - Create an empty List called display.
#For each letter in the chosen_word, add a "_" to 'display'.
#So if the chosen_word was "apple", display should be ["_", "_", "_", "_", "_"] with 5 "_" representing each letter to guess.
display = ["_"] * len(chosen_word)
print(display) 

guess = input("Guess a letter: ").lower()

#TODO-2: - Loop through each position in the chosen_word;
#If the letter at that position matches 'guess' then reveal that letter in the display at that position.
#e.g. If the user guessed "p" and the chosen word was "apple", then display should be ["_", "p", "p", "_", "_"].
for index in range(0, len(chosen_word)):
    if chosen_word[index] == guess:
        display[index] = guess
#TODO-3: - Print 'display' and you should see the guessed letter in the correct position and every other letter replace with "_".
#Hint - Don't worry about getting the user to guess the next letter. We'll tackle that in step 3.
print(display) 


## Hangman 3: Given a randomly chosen word from a list, your goal is to guess all the letters in the word. With each correct guess, reveal the letters in their correct positions. Use a while loop to keep guessing until you've uncovered all the letters and filled in all the blanks ('_').

#Step 3

import random
word_list = ["aardvark", "baboon", "camel"]
chosen_word = random.choice(word_list)
word_length = len(chosen_word)

#Testing code
print(f'Pssst, the solution is {chosen_word}.')

#Create blanks
display = []
for _ in range(word_length):
    display += "_"

#TODO-1: - Use a while loop to let the user guess again. The loop should only stop once the user has guessed all the letters in the chosen_word and 'display' has no more blanks ("_"). Then you can tell the user they've won.

while "_" in display:
    guess = input("Guess a letter: ").lower()
    for position in range(word_length):
        letter = chosen_word[position]
        print(f"Current position: {position}\n Current letter: {letter}\n Guessed letter: {guess}")
        if letter == guess:
            display[position] = letter
    
    print(display)
    
## Hangman 4 - Your task is to guess the letters of a randomly chosen word. But be careful! Each incorrect guess will take away one of your six lives. If you lose all your lives, the game ends. Can you guess all the letters before running out of lives?

## Hangman 5 - To implement the Hangman game in Python, the program should utilize a list of words from the file hangman_words.py. At the beginning of the game, it should display the Hangman logo. Players should be able to guess letters until they either win or lose. The program should provide appropriate feedback for correct and incorrect guesses, and it should also keep track of the remaining lives. If the player's lives reach 0, the game should end.
